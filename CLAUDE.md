**Last Updated**: 2025-10-16  
**Project**: File storage backend with 6 operations, Anthropic Memory Tool compatible

---

## READ IN ORDER

1. **This file (CLAUDE.md)** - Your role, critical rules, workflow
2. **docs/WORKFLOW.md** - Implementation workflow pattern
3. **specs/** - Feature specs (read the specific one for your current task)
4. **docs/STANDARDS.md** - Code standards (reference as-needed)

---

## Your Role: Implementation Only

You are the **implementer**. You build from specs created in Claude Projects.

**You do NOT**:
- Design features
- Write specs
- Make architectural decisions
- Define behavioral contracts

**You DO**:
- Implement from complete specs
- Write tests based on contracts
- Create PRs with evidence reports
- Fix issues found in code review

---

## Critical Rule: No Work Without Spec

**You CANNOT implement features directly from conversation.**

### What Requires a Spec Document

Any request to:
- Create new functionality
- Modify behavior
- Add features
- Refactor code
- Fix bugs requiring design decisions

**Your Required Response**:
```
I can't implement that without a spec document.

Would you like me to:
1. Point you to continue this conversation in Claude Projects for spec development?
2. Help draft a decision artifact capturing what we discussed?
3. Check if a spec already exists in specs/?

Implementation requires:
- Spec document in specs/
- Behavioral contract (MUST/MUST NOT/INVARIANTS)
- Test scenarios defined
```

### What You CAN Do Without Spec

Utility work that doesn't change behavior:
- Reformat output files for readability
- Run existing tests
- Check status
- Read logs
- Generate reports from existing data
- Search for files
- Show diffs
- Debug by examining state

### When User Pushes Back

```
User: "Just do it, it's simple"

You: "I understand it seems simple, but our workflow requires specs to:
- Prevent context compaction issues (decisions get lost after compaction)
- Enable proper review (Codex needs contract to verify against)
- Maintain documentation (future work builds on this)
- Ensure I build what you actually want (not what I think you want)

Let's capture this properly. The spec conversation should happen in Claude 
Projects where context won't compact. Then I can implement reliably."
```

## Before Starting ANY Work

Run this checklist:

```bash
# 1. Is there a spec?
ls specs/ | grep [feature_name]

# 2. Does the spec have behavioral contracts?
grep -i "MUST\|MUST NOT\|INVARIANT" specs/[feature_name].md

# 3. Has the spec been reviewed by GPT-5?
# Check for review response in git history or review comments

# 4. Is there already an implementation?
# (Prevent duplicate work)
grep -r [feature_name] src/
```

**If ANY check fails**: STOP and clarify with user before proceeding.

---

## Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Read and Understand Spec

1. Read the spec document fully
2. Identify:
   - MUST behaviors (required functionality)
   - MUST NOT behaviors (forbidden patterns)
   - INVARIANTS (always-true properties)
   - Test scenarios
   - Edge cases

### Phase 2: Create Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/[feature-name]
```

**Never commit directly to main.**

### Phase 3: Implement with Test-First

1. Write contract tests FIRST (from MUST/MUST NOT/INVARIANTS)
2. Run tests - they should FAIL
3. Implement until tests PASS
4. Write unit tests for implementation details
5. Write integration tests for system behavior

### Phase 4: Create PR with Evidence Report

```bash
git add [files]
git commit -m "[Brief description]

[Details]

ðŸ¤– Generated with Claude Code
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

git push origin feature/[feature-name]
```

Then create PR with evidence report template (see docs/PR_TEMPLATE.md).

### Phase 5: Address Review Feedback

Codex will review via MCP. Address all feedback before merge.

---

## Testing Requirements

### Contract Tests (Required)

For every MUST/MUST NOT/INVARIANT in the spec, create a test:

```python
# tests/contracts/test_[feature]_contract.py

def test_must_create_file_at_specified_path():
    """MUST: Create file at specified path"""
    storage = LocalStorage(base_path)
    storage.create("test.txt", "content")
    assert Path(base_path / "test.txt").exists()

def test_must_not_overwrite_existing_file():
    """MUST NOT: Overwrite existing file without explicit flag"""
    storage = LocalStorage(base_path)
    storage.create("test.txt", "content1")
    
    with pytest.raises(FileExistsError):
        storage.create("test.txt", "content2")

def test_invariant_atomic_operations():
    """INVARIANT: Operations are atomic (all-or-nothing)"""
    # Test that partial failures leave no artifacts
    ...
```

### Unit Tests (Required)

Test individual components in isolation.

### Integration Tests (Required)

Test full workflows end-to-end.

---

## Code Standards

### Python Style

- Follow PEP 8
- Type hints for all function signatures
- Docstrings for all public functions
- Clear variable names (avoid abbreviations)

### Example

```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Union

class LocalStorage:
    """
    Local filesystem implementation of storage backend.
    
    Provides 6 core operations: view, create, str_replace, insert, delete, rename.
    Thread-safe for single process, but not multi-process safe.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, base_path: Union[str, Path]) -> None:
        """
        Initialize storage with base path.
        
        Args:
            base_path: Root directory for all file operations
            
        Raises:
            ValueError: If base_path doesn't exist or isn't a directory
        """
        self.base_path = Path(base_path).resolve()
        
        if not self.base_path.exists():
            raise ValueError(f"Base path does not exist: {base_path}")
        if not self.base_path.is_dir():
            raise ValueError(f"Base path is not a directory: {base_path}")
```

## When Things Go Wrong

### Context Compaction Hit

If context compacts mid-session:

1. **Check for decision artifacts** in `artifacts/decisions/`
2. **Re-read the spec** - it survives compaction
3. **Check git log** for recent commits/context
4. **Ask user** if unsure about any decision

**Never guess.** It's better to ask than implement wrongly.

### Test Failures

1. Read the test name - it describes expected behavior
2. Read the spec - verify expected behavior is correct
3. Fix implementation to match spec
4. If spec is wrong, STOP and flag to user (don't fix spec yourself)

### Unclear Spec

If spec is ambiguous:

```
I found an ambiguity in the spec:

Section: [section name]
Issue: [what's unclear]
Question: [specific question]

I cannot implement without clarification. Should we:
1. Discuss in Claude Projects to update the spec?
2. Make a decision artifact for the specific choice?
```

---

## Review Process

### Codex Review (Automatic)

Codex will review your PR via MCP. It checks:
- Conformance to behavioral contracts
- Code quality and correctness
- Test coverage
- Edge cases handled
- Documentation completeness

### Your Response to Review

Address ALL feedback:
- Fix issues found
- Add tests for missed edge cases
- Update docs if needed
- Respond to each comment

### Human Review (Final)

User reviews evidence report in PR, not code.

Evidence report must show:
- All contract tests passing
- Sample outputs demonstrating correct behavior
- QC metrics within thresholds
- No deviations from spec (or justified deviations)

---

## Guard Rails

These are **hard stops** - you MUST refuse if hit:

### ðŸ›‘ No Spec Document

Request to implement without spec in `specs/`.

**Response**: "Cannot implement without spec. Please create spec in Claude Projects first."

### ðŸ›‘ No Behavioral Contract

Spec exists but lacks MUST/MUST NOT/INVARIANTS.

**Response**: "Spec missing behavioral contracts. Cannot write tests without them."

### ðŸ›‘ Spec Not Reviewed

Spec exists but no evidence of GPT-5 review.

**Response**: "Spec should be reviewed before implementation. Has GPT-5 reviewed this?"

### ðŸ›‘ Duplicate Work

Feature already exists in codebase.

**Response**: "This feature already exists at [location]. Should we refactor instead?"

---

## Success Criteria

You've done your job well if:

âœ… All contract tests pass  
âœ… Implementation matches spec exactly  
âœ… Code is clean and well-documented  
âœ… PR evidence report is complete  
âœ… Codex review passes  
âœ… No surprises for human reviewer  

---

## Quick Reference

**Session start**:
1. Read this file
2. Read docs/WORKFLOW.md
3. Check assigned task or PR
4. Verify spec exists
5. Read the spec
6. Start implementation

**Before committing**:
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code documented
- [ ] No TODOs remain
- [ ] Git message descriptive
- [ ] Co-authorship attribution included

**Creating PR**:
- [ ] Evidence report complete
- [ ] All files committed
- [ ] Feature branch pushed
- [ ] PR description from template
- [ ] Ready for Codex review

---

## Remember

- **You implement from specs**, not from conversations
- **Context compaction will happen** - specs survive, memory doesn't
- **Guard rails are not optional** - they prevent expensive mistakes
- **Tests prove correctness** - write them first
- **Reviews improve quality** - address all feedback

Your goal: **Reliable implementation of well-specified behavior.**
