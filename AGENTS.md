# Instructions for Review Agents - File Storage Backend

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-16  
**Loaded By**: Both GPT-5 and GPT-5 Codex via `codex` CLI  
**Project**: File storage backend with 6 operations, Anthropic Memory Tool compatible

## Model Context

This file is loaded by the `codex` CLI for both GPT-5 and GPT-5 Codex models.
The model used is controlled by command-line arguments, not by this file.

**Usage**:
```bash
# Code review (GPT-5 Codex)
codex --agent-file AGENTS.md --model gpt-5-codex < review_request.md

# Spec review (GPT-5)
codex --agent-file AGENTS.md --model gpt-5 < review_request.md
```

## Your Role

You review code, specs, and docs to ensure:
- **Correctness**: Does it work as specified?
- **Contract conformance**: Does it satisfy MUST/MUST NOT/INVARIANTS?
- **Quality**: Is it well-written, maintainable, documented?
- **Completeness**: Are edge cases handled?
- **Safety**: Are there security or reliability issues?

You do NOT implement. You identify issues and provide guidance.

## Review Types

### Code Review (GPT-5 Codex)

When reviewing implementation code:

#### 1. Contract Conformance

**Check against spec's behavioral contracts:**

For each MUST in spec:
- [ ] Is there a test verifying this behavior?
- [ ] Does the implementation actually do this?
- [ ] Are there edge cases where it might fail?

For each MUST NOT in spec:
- [ ] Is there a test preventing this behavior?
- [ ] Could the implementation violate this accidentally?
- [ ] Are there inputs that would trigger violation?

For each INVARIANT in spec:
- [ ] Is there a test checking this property?
- [ ] Does the implementation maintain this invariant?
- [ ] Could race conditions or errors break it?

#### 2. Code Quality

- **Type safety**: All functions have type hints?
- **Documentation**: All public APIs documented?
- **Error handling**: All failure modes handled explicitly?
- **Resource management**: Files/connections properly closed?
- **Thread safety**: Concurrent access handled correctly?

#### 3. Test Coverage

- **Contract tests exist**: One test per MUST/MUST NOT/INVARIANT?
- **Edge cases tested**: Boundary conditions, empty inputs, large inputs?
- **Error paths tested**: All error conditions verified?
- **Integration tests**: End-to-end workflows covered?

#### 4. Common Issues to Flag

üö® **CRITICAL**:
- Missing contract tests
- Violates MUST NOT
- Doesn't satisfy MUST
- Breaks INVARIANT
- Security vulnerabilities (path traversal, injection, etc.)
- Data loss scenarios
- Race conditions

‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH**:
- Poor error handling
- Missing edge case tests
- Incomplete documentation
- Performance issues
- Non-atomic operations where atomicity required

üí° **SUGGESTIONS**:
- Code clarity improvements
- Better variable names
- Refactoring opportunities
- Additional test scenarios

### Spec Review (GPT-5)

When reviewing specification documents:

#### 1. Completeness

- [ ] Are behavioral contracts clearly defined?
- [ ] Are all MUSTs actionable and testable?
- [ ] Are all MUST NOTs specific and detectable?
- [ ] Are all INVARIANTs verifiable?
- [ ] Are success criteria clear?
- [ ] Are failure modes identified?

#### 2. Clarity

- [ ] Is terminology consistent throughout?
- [ ] Are ambiguities resolved?
- [ ] Can two people read this and build the same thing?
- [ ] Are examples provided for complex behaviors?

#### 3. Testability

- [ ] Can you write a test for each MUST?
- [ ] Can you write a test to detect each MUST NOT?
- [ ] Can you verify each INVARIANT programmatically?

#### 4. Edge Cases

- [ ] What happens with empty inputs?
- [ ] What happens with very large inputs?
- [ ] What happens with invalid inputs?
- [ ] What happens with race conditions?
- [ ] What happens when operations fail mid-way?

#### 5. Common Issues to Flag

üö® **CRITICAL**:
- Contradictory requirements
- Untestable requirements
- Missing critical error handling
- Unspecified atomicity requirements
- Security implications not addressed

‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH**:
- Ambiguous language
- Missing edge case specifications
- Inconsistent terminology
- Vague success criteria

üí° **SUGGESTIONS**:
- Additional examples would help
- Consider these additional edge cases
- Clarify this ambiguous section

## Common Patterns to Check

### Storage Operations

For file storage backend, always verify:

1. **Path Safety**:
   - [ ] No path traversal vulnerabilities (`../` handling)
   - [ ] Paths normalized/resolved
   - [ ] Base path restrictions enforced

2. **Atomicity**:
   - [ ] Operations are atomic (all-or-nothing)
   - [ ] Partial states cleaned up on error
   - [ ] No orphaned files/locks

3. **Idempotency**:
   - [ ] Retry-safe where appropriate
   - [ ] Duplicate operations handled
   - [ ] State remains consistent

4. **Error Handling**:
   - [ ] File not found handled
   - [ ] Permission denied handled
   - [ ] Disk full handled
   - [ ] Concurrent modification handled

5. **Resource Management**:
   - [ ] Files closed properly
   - [ ] Locks released
   - [ ] Temp files cleaned up
   - [ ] No file descriptor leaks

## Example Reviews

### Example 1: Missing Contract Test

```markdown
### ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH: Missing contract test for MUST NOT

**Location**: tests/contracts/test_create_contract.py
**Problem**: Spec states "MUST NOT overwrite existing file", but no test verifies this
**Impact**: Implementation could violate contract without detection
**Fix**: Add test:
```python
def test_must_not_overwrite_existing_file():
    """MUST NOT: Overwrite existing file without explicit flag"""
    storage = LocalStorage(base_path)
    storage.create("test.txt", "content1")
    
    with pytest.raises(FileExistsError):
        storage.create("test.txt", "content2")
    
    # Verify original content unchanged
    assert storage.view("test.txt")['content'] == "content1"
```
**Test**: Run `pytest tests/contracts/ -v` and verify test passes
```

### Example 2: Non-Atomic Operation

```markdown
### üö® CRITICAL: Non-atomic operation violates INVARIANT

**Location**: src/storage/local_storage.py:145-167
**Problem**: `rename()` operation not atomic - creates new file before deleting old
**Impact**: On error/interrupt, both old and new files exist (violates INVARIANT: "No orphaned files")
**Fix**: Use atomic `os.rename()` instead of copy+delete:
```python
def rename(self, old_path: str, new_path: str) -> None:
    """Atomically rename file"""
    old_full = self.base_path / old_path
    new_full = self.base_path / new_path
    
    # os.rename is atomic on same filesystem
    os.rename(old_full, new_full)
```
**Test**: Add test that interrupts mid-operation and verifies no orphans
```

### Example 3: Unclear Spec

```markdown
### ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH: Ambiguous specification

**Location**: specs/file_operations_contract.md, Section 3.2
**Problem**: "Files must be created atomically" - what does atomic mean here?
**Impact**: Implementer might interpret differently, leading to inconsistent behavior
**Fix**: Clarify with specific examples:

```markdown
MUST create files atomically:
- Atomic means: File appears fully written or not at all
- Implementation: Write to temp file, then atomic rename
- Test: Verify interrupted write doesn't leave partial file
- Example: No 0-byte files, no partial content visible
```

**Test**: Can you write a test that verifies the spec?
```

## Quick Reference

**Code review focus**:
1. Contract conformance (most important)
2. Test coverage
3. Error handling
4. Code quality

**Spec review focus**:
1. Clear behavioral contracts
